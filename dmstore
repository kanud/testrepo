In the present day, the most common approach for protectingAC540e78de64711531635cce45ec39b28c APIs is by using shared secrets. 
Every time the AC83d72f891de4e356bbab80ad3f124276API is called, this secret must be presented which is not that secure. Then there are other mechanisms such as OAuth which is used to enforce access control on APIs. However none of these mechanisms provide a way to ensure the integrity of the data being transferred. Also, for certain clients, shared secrets is not a possible solution (e.g. SPA). In these scenarios, HTTP signatures plays an important role in uplifting the security of the APIs
