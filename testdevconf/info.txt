The "one-line" comment styles only comment to the end of the line or the current block of PHP code, 
whichever comes first. This means that HTML code after // ... ?> or # ... ?> WILL be printed: ?> breaks out of PHP mode and returns to HTML mode, and // or # cannot influence that. If the asp_tags configuration directive is enabled, it behaves the same with // %> and # %>. 
However, the </script> tag doesn't break out of PHP mode in a one-line comment.
